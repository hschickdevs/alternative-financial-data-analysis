This is the source code for a project that Suhas and I completed for our Big Data/Distributed Programming class in our Master of Science in IT & Management at the University of Texas at Austin.

The purpose of this project was to investigate the utility of alternative financial data in predicting US equity prices and making trading decisions. The project contains three main investigations: congress trading, patent analysis, and insider trading analysis. Please see the sections below.
